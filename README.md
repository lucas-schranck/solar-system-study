# 🌌 Solar System Simulation – Study & Project Repository

Welcome! This repository documents my **step-by-step journey** to create a fully editable, realistic **3D Solar System Simulation** in Python.  

It includes everything:  
- Physics study notes 📘  
- Python experiments 💻  
- Simulations and prototypes 🌍  
- Final organized project 🚀  

This repo is not just the finished code, but also the **path of learning** that led there.

## 📅 Study Plan (10 Weeks)

The project is based on a structured **10-week study plan** (1–2 hours a day, Mon–Fri).  
The main goal: **build a physically accurate, 3D solar system simulation**.

👉 [Click here to see the full detailed plan](./study_plan.md)  
*(The weekly breakdown, resources, and daily topics are in a separate file for clarity.)*

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** for vector math
- **VPython / GlowScript** for 3D visualization
- **JSON** for data/configs
- Possibly: `matplotlib` (for graphs), `tkinter` or another lightweight UI
- Possibly later: `Unity` (for UI and interactive tweaking), or some other tools.

## 🌟 Goals
1. Learn/review classical physics, orbital mechanics, and numerical simulations.
2. Improve Python OOP and simulation coding skills.
3. Create a **realistic, scalable solar system simulation**.
4. Document the entire learning process for others to follow.

## 🌠 Final Note
This is more than just a coding project, it’s a **learning log**.  
By the end, the repository will contain both the **final simulation** and the **steps that built it**.
